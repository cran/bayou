\title{Loads a bayou object}
\usage{
load.bayou(bayouFit, save.Rdata = TRUE, file = NULL, cleanup = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{bayouFit}{An object of class \code{bayouFit} produced by the function \code{bayou.mcmc()}}

\item{save.Rdata}{A logical indicating whether the resulting chains should be saved as an *.rds file}

\item{file}{An optional filename (possibly including path) for the saved *.rds file}

\item{cleanup}{A logical indicating whether the files produced by \code{bayou.mcmc()} should be removed.}
}
\description{
\code{load.bayou} loads a bayouFit object that was created using \code{bayou.mcmc()}
}
\details{
If both \code{save.Rdata} is \code{FALSE} and \code{cleanup} is \code{TRUE}, then \code{load.bayou} will trigger a
warning and ask for confirmation. In this case, if the results of \code{load.bayou()} are not stored in an object,
the results of the MCMC run will be permanently deleted.
