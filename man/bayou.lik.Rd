\title{Function for calculating likelihood of an OU model in bayou using the threepoint algorithm}
\usage{
bayou.lik(pars, cache, X, model = "OU")
}
\arguments{
\item{pars}{A list of parameters to calculate the likelihood}

\item{cache}{A bayou cache object generated using .prepare.ou.univariate}

\item{X}{A named vector giving the tip data}

\item{model}{Parameterization of the OU model. Either "OU", "QG" or "OUrepar".}
}
\description{
Function for calculating likelihood of an OU model in bayou using the threepoint algorithm
}
\details{
This function implements the algorithm of Ho and Ane (2014) implemented
 in the package \code{phylolm} for the \code{OUfixedRoot} model. It is faster
 than the equivalent pruning algorithm in geiger, and can be used on non-
 ultrametric trees (unlike OU.lik, which is based on the pruning algorithm in
 geiger).
